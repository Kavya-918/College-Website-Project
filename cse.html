        <h3>ABOUT CSE DEPARTMENT</h3>
    </center>
    <p>
        The Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) was established in the year 2001 with a vision to
        provide a place for Innovation, Scientific Discovery and New Technology, to evolve as a Centre of Excellence in
        Research and Learning, Integrating Computer and Information Sciences with Natural Sciences and Basic
        Engineering.

    The Department was started with UG programme B.Tech (Computer Science & Engineering) with an Initial intake of
        60 . By the explorative growth of Computer Science and by Globalization of Economies, the rise in demand for
        computing professionals in all disciplines was imperative. So the department increased the intake and developed
        new courses with industry-relevant curriculum to cater the imminent need.
