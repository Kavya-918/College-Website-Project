    <center><h3>ABOUT CIVIL DEPARTMENT</h3></center>
    <p>
        The Department of Civil Engineering has a wide array of most modern laboratory equipment that can adequately
        cater to the varied demands of B.Tech, M.Tech students along with different consultancy and research
        requirements. The department has state of the art infrastructure facilities. It consists of class rooms with LCD
        projectors and a dedicated departmental library with a decent collection of books in addition to the College
        Central Library.

    The syllabus prescribed for both B.Tech & M.Tech courses is a fine blend of theoretical knowledge and practical
        applications. The syllabus is framed as per current developments in the field of Civil Engineering, with a clear
        focus on bridging the gap between classroom learning and industry demands. The department is strengthened with
        highly qualified and dedicated faculty members having rich teaching, research and industrial experience.

      The Department of Civil Engineering was established in the year 2008 with a modest intake of 60 students. The
        Department started M.Tech course in Structural Engineering in the year 2013 with an intake of 18 students.
        Subsequently in the year 2014, the B.Tech intake increased to 120 students. The Department is headed by Dr. G
        Prabhakaran who has more than 24 years of teaching and 8 years of industrial experience.

        To provide students with the fundamental technical knowledge and skills in mathematics, science and
        engineering to recognize and solve problems in the areas of structural design, geo-technical, Transportation,
        Water resources and environmental engineering.
    To provide students with the necessary skills and practical experience to fulfill their professional duties
        and responsibilities in teamwork, ethics, technical leadership, business acumen and lifelong learning.
     To make the students be in a position to practice professionally in various positions in industry or
        government and succeed in graduate or other professional schools.
    To mould the students to become future engineers, scientists, researchers, and innovators and make substantial
        contributions to the society of civil engineers.
To prepare the students to be successful engineers or managers meeting the global industrial requirements.
    To make the students put constant efforts to improve the living quality of all walks of life by solving wide
        range of problems.
