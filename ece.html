        <h3>ABOUT EEE DEPARTMENT</h3>
    </center>
    <p>
        The department of ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONICS ENGINEERING (EEE) has been playing a pioneering role in producing
        scientists and technologists of good caliber. EEE department is to create talented and socially responsible
        engineers to make a better India and, in turn, a better world.

Electrical Engineers design systems that generate, transmit and distribute electricity. Electronics engineers
        design electronic devices which perform computation, communication, or control of robots and machines.
        Electrical and Electronics engineers work with technologies ranging from large power lines and generators to
        tiny integrated circuits containing billions of transistors.

The department has well-equipped laboratory facilities for the students such as Electrical Machine Lab, Basic
        Electrical and Network lab, Control & Instrumentation Lab, Power Electronics & Drives Lab with sophisticated
        equipment like dSPACE and Power Quality Analyser are available with the department. The infrastructure and lab
        facilities are upgraded from time to time and provide adequate opportunities for students to learn and innovate.

Electrical and Electronics engineers are highly employable and can find work in many areas. An Electrical and
        Electronics engineer designs, develops and maintains the electrical, electronics and computer control system to
        the required specifications, and focusing on economy, reliability, safety, sustainability and quality. Telecom
        industries, transportation network, IT industries, airplane & airspace manufacturing industries, production and
        the distribution of power are some of the specific fields of career development. An Electrical and Electronics
        engineer can work with the industries deals in product development, control system, system management, product
        design, sales, consumers electronics, transportation, wireless communication, manufacturing, chemical,
        automotive, defense and space research organizations.

Interested candidates can also build their career in teaching and research. They can join prestigious
        institutions for earning Master of Technology (M.Tech) degree and Ph.D degree in Electrical and Electronics
        Engineering.

Founded in 2002, the Department of EEE has made rapid strides with the intake of 60, enhanced to 120 after four
        years. Till now 16 batches of students have graduated. The Department is headed by Dr. N.Ramesh Raju who has 21
        years teaching experience & 4 Years Industrial Experience. The Department has competent, committed and
        well-qualified motivated faculty of 42 members possessing Ph.D and M.Tech. in various specializations.
